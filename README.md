# film-project

A full-stack web project which allows the user to view the hottest film picks of the month from every category (action, sci-fi, comedy, adventure) as well as the actors and directors, with the option to like as many films as the user wishes so that he can later view them on his personal user page.

If you wish to view the webpage you must:
* Install xampp on the following url: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html
* Place the downloaded github project folder on ajax's folder "htdocs"
* Open xampp control panel and start both apache and mysql
* Click admin on mysql
* Click new to create new database and name it "movie_showcase"
* Click your newly created database and import the .sql file from the project 
* Finally place the following url on your internet bar: localhost/film-project/index.php
